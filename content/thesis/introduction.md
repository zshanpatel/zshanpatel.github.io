# Introduction

<div class="popover-hint">

In my exploration of Islamic thought, I've encountered a recurring issue in the
historical literature on Islam dating back to the seventeenth century: a
pervasive bias and hostility toward Islam, as noted by Iqbal (1930).
Particularly, when searching for literature on the intersection of prosperity
and Islam, I discovered limited sources, with most assuming prosperity to be
synonymous with material wealth (Raimi, 2018). Moreover, some of the
literature addressing the concept of prosperity in Islam is available in
languages such as Arabic and Urdu. While not extensively using the term
prosperity, many scholars have approached the expansive subject of human
purpose in Islam (Ahmed, 2001; Armstrong, 2013; Barlas, 2002; Beekun and
Badawi 2005; Chapra, 1992; 2002; Choudhury and Hussain 2005; Esposito,
1991; Hosein, 1997; Naqvi, 1994). This highlights a significant gap in
academic literature concerning the specific construct of prosperity within the
context of Islam.

My research seeks to bridge the existing gap by conducting an in-depth
linguistic analysis of the Qur'an, the sacred text of Islam, in order to extract
insights related to the concept of prosperity. I must acknowledge that I have
just begun to explore this extensive undertaking. Nonetheless, my work aims
to reveal Qur'anic perspective on prosperity and assess its relevance.

This thematic paper critically evaluates the contemporary secular economic
system while exploring prosperity from a Qur'anic standpoint. I juxtapose
Islamic concepts of prosperity with secular theoretical frameworks, drawing
from an early Islamic ethos to establish a foundation for Universal Prosperity
(UP). My research delves into both secular and theological concepts as
complementary themes, aiming to uncover relationships between scientific,
quantitative approaches firmly grounded in empiricism (Ferraro et al., 2015),
and more abstract, qualitative paradigms rooted in divinity, faith, and belief
(Collins, 2007). Through this exploration, I intend to reveal a source of
epistemic influences (Dougherty, 2017) that can conceptualise for radical re-
evaluation of prosperity (Moore & Mintchev, 2021).

Arguably, contrary to Hawken's perspective (as cited by Ferraro et al., 2015),
this paper posits the monotheistic framework as a central, unifying ideology
for a meta-dimensional social justice movement capable of holistically
addressing Grand Challenges (GCs).

## Outline

<div class="popover-hint">
This dissertation is organized into six distinct sections, each contributing to
a comprehensive understanding of the research objectives.

First, I examine the modern-contemporary context through a comprehensive
review of relevant literature. And explore the antecedents that shaped the
current economic system and socio-cultural thinking. Second, I do a
historical overview of Islam, tracing its development from its early ethos and
contemporary interpretations. I draw distinction between contemporary
Islamic concepts and the foundational principles of early Islam.

Third, I contextualise the Qur'anic thinking for transformative change.
Fourth, I develop a model for UP, and dwell into constitutes of prosperity
pathways for comparison purposes. I identify and analyse three distinct
pathways to prosperity: econometric-focused, holistic-focused, and divine-
focused UP. Fifth, I explore the dimensions that constitute the UP path,
providing a detailed examination of its components, showcasing its practical
implementation and outcomes.

Finally, in the Discussion section I explore integration of the practical and
theoretical dimensions of UP and reflect on the implications of the research
findings for future studies and applications. I propose using UP as a lens for
analysing various subjects and its potential to contribute to radical collective
prosperity.

## Aim and Objectives

<div class="popover-hint">
The primary aim of this dissertation is to investigate the interconnectedness
of Islamic concepts and their relationship with the notion of prosperity. It
seeks to generate profound insights and identify thematic challenges within
the contemporary context. This research aims to bridge the gap between
scientific and mystical approaches, exploring a unique pathway to
understanding prosperity.

To achieve the overarching aim, the objectives have been to conduct a
comprehensive examination of Islamic concepts and their historical
development, differentiating between contemporary interpretations and early
Islamic principles. Use theoretical frameworks to draw comprehensive
analysis of the multifaceted dimensions that contribute to prosperity,
encompassing institutions and ecosystems. Identify and analyse distinct
pathways to prosperity, including econometric-focused, holistic-focused, and
divine-focused approaches. Construct a model for UP by integrating diverse
pathways and dimensions of prosperity found within Islamic epistemology.
Investigate the multifaceted dimensions that constitute the UP model and
empirically assess its applicability and outcomes. Inferring from prophecy,
explore the potential synergies between scientific and mystical epistemologies
within the context of Islamic thought, seeking to create a comprehensive
understanding. And address the central research question:

How does a Qur'anic epistemology contribute to the development of a
comprehensive model for predicted universal prosperity?

## Rationale and Background

<div class="popover-hint">
The approach to addressing GCs in academic discourse often involves a
combination of theory and action, with a focus on complex subjects that can
be distilled into actionable inputs. For instance, strategies may involve
leveraging innovation and entrepreneurship to combat global
malnourishment or optimizing socio-economic factors such as national
resource allocation and consumption patterns. Typically, these strategies are
capital-dependent, with the industrial sector (Esquivel, 2016) playing a
pivotal role in achieving complementary development objectives linked to the
mitigation of GCs. Resulting in stakeholders often balancing priorities
between private and collective gains.

It is crucial to approach this exploration with cultural sensitivity and a
profound understanding of Islamic principles, practices, and historical
contexts. The monotheistic worldview within Islam considers economic
development as a subset of broader socio-economic and environmental
aspects (Aá¸¥mad, 1994). By identifying critical intervention points (as defined
by Meadows, 1999) within this system, the Qur'an unveils underlying causal
factors that give rise to the complexities of GCs (Waddock et al., 2015).

For example, in contrast to secular institutions and agents who often employ
a pragmatist theoretical approach (Whitford, 2002, p. 341, as cited by Ferraro
et al., 2015) in addressing problems and seeking solutions, the Qur'an directly
confronts issues related to interest-based financial systems (Qur'an 2:275;
3:30; 4:161), which it views as a significant contributor to modern societal
oppression. This view is compounded by the presence of speculative fictitious
monetary system (Pettifor, 2017) and the prevalence of debt-based market
societies (Ahmed, 2010). A perspective shared by colonized nations grappling
with the implications of financial enslavement (Mbembe and Dubois, 2017).
The Islamic belief system advocates for socio-economic well-being as a
foundation for inclusive financial prosperity (Harker and Horton, 2022).

One pertinent question that emerges from this discussion is why a
monotheistic approach is relevant in an age characterized by 'innovism'
(McCloskey and Silvestri, 2021). This question can be best addressed by
synthesizing epistemic sources as articulated by secular scholars and
prophesied within Islam's eschatological framework (Shoemaker, 2014).

## Approach to Research

<div class="popover-hint">
This paper employs a qualitative analysis methodology to delve into its
overarching theme, embracing the realm of interpretative social sciences
(Neuman, 1997). The research involves a meticulous analysis of diverse
schools of thought relevant to the topic, spanning from epistemology and
philosophy within the social sciences to pragmatic examinations of historical,
and economic systems. The foundation for engaging with these concepts lies
in the context of a theological monotheistic system, as defined by the Qur'an,
extending from the dawn of civilization through the early Islamic ethos to the
contemporary era.

This paper adopts a unique ontological approach by exploring scholarship
from an Islamic perspective. To establish contextual relevance, the study
draws insights from the field of organizational management and social
sciences (Adair-Toteff, 2016), particularly as they relate to contemporary
landscapes characterized by innovation and entrepreneurship. The choice of
interpretive qualitative methodology is driven by several factors. Firstly, the
intertwined and transdisciplinary nature of the research challenges makes it
challenging to examine these themes in isolation. Qualitative methods are
best suited to unravel the complexities and interrelations within the system
(Patel and Mehta, 2017). Additionally, these themes often lack quantitative
data, given their philosophical and comprehensive nature.

The Qur'anic understanding serves as the foundation for analysis. Using
structuration theory (Giddens, 1984, as cited by Tlaiss and McAdam, 2021)
facilitates the exploration of the dynamic relationships between agency and
systems and their properties within structural systems, allowing for the
convergence of abstract epistemic sources. Further, I elaborate the thinking
of the Qur'anic perspective using Scharmer's (2018) Theory U which
addresses complex change using insight. To provide an empirical perspective,
the study incorporates the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework, which
assists in situating concepts within different system levels for more
comprehensive analysis (Geels, 2019).

The research draws on a wide range of literature, including documented
scriptures, to capture critical historical philosophies and integrate them into
mainstream scholarship. Islamic concepts are primarily derived from
interpretations of the Qur'an and Hadeeth (literature on sayings, actions, and
approvals of Muhammad PBUH). It's worth noting that the historiography of
Islamic scholarly literature has been a subject of dispute among Western
secular scholars and Islamic scholars, with further differences arising
between sects of Sunni and Shia. To establish a unified religious standpoint,
this study considers the Qur'an as the core source, supplemented by
documented accounts of Muhammad's (PBUH) life and his companions, for
the purpose of justifiable verification. This critical analysis is further enriched
by seminal works from contemporary Islamic scholars who hold prominence
in both Islamic and Western academia, such as Fazlur Rahman (1958) and
Muhammad Iqbal (1930).

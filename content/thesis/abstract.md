# Abstract

Prosperity represents a multifaceted paradigm rooted in ancient interests.
This dissertation delves into the concept of prosperity in the contemporary
world. It draws a comparison with early Islam and the Qurâ€™an, the final divine
revelation that catalysed significant social change, transcending economic
and political structures. Employing a diverse range of methodologies, from
philosophical inquiry to empirical analysis, this study aims to present a
multidimensional perspective capable of fostering enduring and equitable
prosperity. It introduces the concept of "universal prosperity" as a novel
approach to contemporary challenges.
This dissertation advocates a reconsideration of socio-economic ethos to focus
on the root causes of Grand Challenges. Drawing inspiration from divine
sources, it proposes a model addressing tectonic change in systemic
structures, bridging medieval concepts with contemporary realities.
Consequently, this work offers analytical filters for assessing future
approaches and invites further scrutiny.
By examining unconventional epistemic models, including eschatological
beliefs, pathways to prosperity and radical systems rethinking, this study
concludes that academic concepts derived from the monotheistic tradition,
coupled with a revivalist monotheistic perspective, can lay the groundwork for
transformative global outcomes.

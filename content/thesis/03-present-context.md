In this section, I delve deeper into the contours of the human system from
pragmatic philosophical perspective of secular thinking that arguably has laid
the ground for the modern system and epistemic violation of spiritual
epistemologies.
The perception of religion is often viewed as regressive in the context of
modernism and innovation (Gümüsay, 2015). Paradoxically, materialistic
atheist systems have reached their logical limits, evident by the decline of
communism and the erosion of capitalism (Ahmed, 2001). Throughout
history, various socio-political systems have adopted different approaches to
public life, ranging from state governance and collective collaboration to
independent agency (Fackler, 2020; Kagitcibasi, 1997).
In medieval and pre-modern societies, religion played a central role,
influencing socio-political, economic, communal, familial, and individual
aspects of life. It provided explanations for natural phenomena, moral
guidance, and social norms. However, the past century has witnessed the rise
of the industrial revolution, ushering in systemic advancements driven by
pragmatism and postmodern societal structures. Traditional epistemic
institutions have eroded, giving way to a market-based ethos (Polanyi, 1977)
and a slow but steady spirito-epistemic decline. While modern civilization has
introduced innovations with good intentions, they have also brought about
unintended challenges (Khavul and Bruton, 2013). Compounding these
innovations have failed to provide sustainable and holistic solutions,
deepening individualistic motivations and resulting in modern hyper-
consumerism, rooted in private gains often at a collective loss.
Simultaneously, present social and environmental crises have led to a re-
evaluation of capital-centric neoliberal thinking, which prioritizes individual
gains (Hickel, 2021). Ongoing socio-ecological crises (Foster and Clark, 2009)
have exposed deep-seated issues within the economic system (Hickel, 2019).
Despite the significant contribution to social, economic, and ecological
degradation, institutions continue the pursuit of economic growth.
It is crucial to move beyond positivist policies and strategies anchored in
economic growth (e.g., Green Deals, Energy Transitions) and instead
strategize for transformations that consider tectonic implications. Human
civilization faces an eventual finality, akin to the Armageddon or eschaton in
scriptural terms (Flipper, 2015). Meadows et al. (1972) utilized computer
modelling to analyse the potential consequences of unhinged exponential
economic globalization and accelerated growth on Earth's finite resources.
They warned that if current growth trends persist, they could lead to a
collapse of the global ecosystem and civilization as we know it (ibid.). A thirty-
year update (2005) to their findings reaffirmed their predictions, highlighting
the importance for collective collaboration and actionable change.

## Secular Social Thinking
In the seventeenth century, history saw a transition of thought from religious
dominion to the emergence of pragmatism thinking shaped by various
cultural, intellectual, and social factors. The Enlightenment (1685-1815)
marked a shift towards reason, empiricism, and scientific inquiry.
Philosophers began contending traditional religious dogmas and advocating
for rational thought and evidence-based knowledge. Enlightenment thinkers
promoted secular values and individual rights, challenging the authority of
religious institutions (Ahmed, 2001). They emphasized the separation of
church and state, arguing for a release of intellectual freedom and social
progress. The emerging secular scholars approached thinking from diverse
angles spanning sociology, philosophy, and an interplay between these fields.
Their nuanced intersectional understandings of complex dynamic economic
systems and societal interactions furthered secular thinking. Secular
humanism (Flipper, 2015) emerged as a worldview emphasizing human
reason, ethics, and well-being without reliance on religious authority and
religion was realised as limited to a medium for social cohesion of the masses,
and a passing social institution, symbolised by synagogues, temples,
churches and masjids (Ahmed, 2001).
Relative to history of civilization, the modern archetype of capitalism and
socialism are a new phenomenon, their early thinking originating in the
seventeenth century (Hobsbawm, 1960). The Islamic monothetic system
fundamentally rejects both these value systems as exploitative, failing to treat
human’s agency as a viceregent of God (Ahmad, 1994). Both systems fail to
meet their social, economic, ecological, political and moral challenges for a
just economic system and in essence re-interpretate moral ethical values in
economic terms. In addition to the ideological, socio-political and moral
differences in frameworks, the major fundamental difference is in the
underlying development strategies of both these systems – industrialization.
Theoretically both these systems remain in the pursuit of ‘outgrowth of capital
theory’ (ibid.).
Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations (1776) laid the foundation for classical
economics and capitalist thought. Smith's analysis emphasized the role of
self-interest and competition in driving economic growth. Smith (1970)
acknowledged religion to be fundamental in economics. His philosophy
emphasized natural order and the benefits of individual freedom and
economic liberalism. Smith’s work spoke of the invisible hand that guides the
market, and he viewed markets as mechanisms that could promote prosperity
without extensive intervention of polities. Max Weber theorised that the
Christian Protestant ethic with the belief of finding salvation through work
was to become the foundation of what he referred to the Capitalist spirit
(Weber, 2013). He saw Capitalism to be universal. Weber (Morrison, 1995)
believed that civilization had entered the third age, of bureaucratic authority
and bureaucracy achieves power by knowledge or its pretence. Karl Marx's
analysis critiqued the power dynamics between the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat within capitalist systems (Morrison, 1995). Marx's dialectical
materialism theory focused on historical material conditions and class
relations. Marx famously referred to religion as the "opium of the masses"
(Marx, 1994). Bertrand Russell was a proponent of secular humanism and a
critique of organized religion and economic systems. He criticized religious
dogmas of using religion to consolidate power and inhibiting individual
freedom. Russell (1946) brought together implications of early civilization
philosophical thinking and its incremental impact on the modern, political,
social and economic system. While his philosophical stance was an expansive
disbandment of religious thinking, Russell also critiqued unchecked
capitalism and the concentration of wealth, arguing for social reforms to
counteract the power imbalances inherent in capitalist systems. Emile
Durkheim explored the collective consciousness, and the role of institutions
and social integration (Morrison, 1995). He explored how societal norms and
values influenced capitalist dynamics. Durkheim's philosophy emphasized
the study of social facts and the impact of collective consciousness on
individual behaviour. Durkheim had a more optimistic outlook of the
functions of religion, emphasizing its role in promoting social unity and order.
Morrison (1995) elaborates on the secular modern social thought and its
dynamics illustrating the realignment of social systems in economic contexts.

### Transactional Society System
The system rooted in capitalist thinking, gradually disassociated itself from
moral and divine considerations. This transformation has propelled the
emergence of a financial structure anchored in debt, akin to what some
scholars have termed a contemporary colonial strategy (Pettifor and Debt
Crisis Network, 1996).
In today's economy, individualistic profit motives take precedence over
collective societal needs. Humanity has transitioned from a society that uses
markets to exchange value, to a market society (Polanyi, 1977) where the
market itself governs aspects of humanity. This shift has left the foundations
of social systems vulnerable to financial crises. Debt has become an integral
part of economic activity, leading to a cycle of borrowing and repayment that
diverts significant portions of wealth toward debt servicing. This pattern
threatens long-term financial stability and exacerbates wealth inequality.
Concentration of financial power restricts the circulation of wealth,
perpetuating a widening wealth and power gap. Central financial institutions
wield significant influence, enabling them to maintain international
supremacy and exert control over nations (Bendell and Greco, 2013).
The system's inherent flaw lies in the near-universal power it grants to select
private elites, driven by the principle of "how can I get something for nothing"
(Pettifor, 2017). Financial institutions and the debt-based economic system
hold countries financially captive through lending practices, as vividly
depicted in John Perkins' Confessions of an Economic Hitman (2023). Nations
find themselves accountable to financial institutions, often at the expense of
their socio-political agency. Delineated as a form of financial enslavement
(Nkrumah, 1965).
Activists and scholars emphasize spatial debt's crippling impact on society,
with the debt crisis being just one facet of plutocratic finance (Pettifor, 1996).
Casagranda (2023) defined politics as the “intentional manipulation of the
economic realm and normative realm to create a desired outcome” (ibid.,
2023, 00:03:32). Today's system is dysfunctional, morally devoid, and
speculative, with no intrinsic backing. It's governed by self-interested
regulators and results in recurring financial crises (Global Financial Stability
Report, April 2023), financial meltdowns (e.g., 2008 Global Financial Crisis)
(Anon, 2012), and high inflation rates (Ha et al., 2021).
Historically, money was linked to commodities like gold, providing stability
based on supply and demand. However, in today's system, detached from
commodities, money creation has grown exponentially. Banks fictitiously
create new money through loans (Pettifor, 2017), contributing to an endless
flow of funds from the public to banks—a 'Ponzi-financing' scheme (Greenham
and Ryan-Collins, 2013). Consequently, we have the modern concept of
runaway inflation, a hyper rise in the general price level, occurring when
there's too much money chasing too few goods and services (Quantity-Theory
framework). The transition from gold-backed money has led to currency
devaluation over time, as opposed to the stability seen in commodity-based
systems (Hawkes, 2021).

## Epistemic Imperialism
Neo-colonialism has taken the form of monetary imperialism (Anievas and
Nisancioglu, 2015), epistemological and cultural subjugation (Nkrumah,
1965). With the rise of capitalism, Eurocentrism became prominent in
Western historiography (Anievas and Nisancioglu, 2015). This colonial
influence continues to shape systems such as education, and trade ethics and
business practices (Khan and Naguib, 2019). Imperialistic systems have
exerted control over socio-economic-political structures (Heller, 2018; Anievas
and Nisancioglu, 2013) while marginalizing non-Eurocentric value systems.
Bertrand Russell (Russell et al., 2020), criticized communism and fascism for
their emphasis on knowledge solely for practical utility. Russell (1947)
highlights the Church's historical role in violent religious campaigns like the
Crusades, the actions by the Church during the medieval period had an
impact on intellectual pursuits, free thought and social progress (ibid.) and
set the stage for an impeding narrative of religious oppression. This historical
oppression has influenced contemporary perceptions of Islam and religion in
general.
During the Enlightenment, there was epistemic violence in the development
of non-secular philosophies and epistemologies. This history of philosophies
overlooks the medieval Eastern scholarship (500-1300) that explored the
interplay between the divine and the natural world in science. Medieval
Eastern scholars fostered a tolerant environment that encouraged diverse
ideas, promoting harmony between Islamic theology and sciences forming
intellectual communities and developing theological epistemic pathways
(Bakhromovich, 2021).
Monotheistic belief systems such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
emerged over time, with Islam considered the final revelation (Qur’an 29:46;
Armstrong, 1999). This rich tapestry of beliefs illustrates the evolving nature
of ideologies and their historical contexts. However, today Islam's perception
is contested and marginalized, rooted in historical epistemic violence (Sevea,
2012). Reconsidering from an Islamic epistemic perspective involves a fusion
of faith and rationality. While material science limits itself to the observable,
religion embraces the unseen and is grounded in faith in the divine (Neubert,
2019). The religious epistemic approach does not confine itself to what is
known or provable, often conflicting with secular scientific theories.

### Imposition of Secular Knowledge
Science, an inquiry-based system focused on understanding the physical
world, often appears in conflict with divine perspectives, as described by
Busenitz and Lichtenstein (2019). Discussions typically revolve around
material dualities like capitalism versus socialism, private ownership versus
state control, with non-secular divine epistemic systems seen as systemically
disparaging.
What's often overlooked in secular discussions is the dimension of divinity. A
similar oversight occurs in the concept of neoliberalism, which primarily
identifies the lacking in capital-led systems but essentially only addresses a
nuanced question of "free market or not." I argue that this question goes
beyond the mere presence of a physical market; by delving into the system's
regulatory framework and the criteria for state involvement in economic
enterprises, the question dodges the pretext of higher morality and ethics
systems.
Secular epistemology tends to lean toward individual-centred or collective-
centred systems in its comprehensive capacity to material outcomes, whereas
divine knowledge suggests the existence of knowledge beyond the material
world. This contrast offers a radial perspective. It's crucial to consider both
perspectives because they complement each other. Science, at a micro and
macro level, deals with quantifiable operations, while divine perspectives
provide an ecosystem-level framework supported by ethical philosophies
rooted in higher morality.
Both science and divinity form the polar foundations for understanding theme
of divine knowledge, which is metaphysical and based on faith in God. While
science relies on rationale and provable facts (Neubert, 2019), divine
knowledge takes a different epistemic premise.

### Synchronicity, God and Science
Despite religion being a central topic in society it is often overlooked (Smith
et al., 2019). Secular scholarship in the sciences often emphasizes empiricism
and objectivity, seemingly at odds with theological thinking, and vice versa.
Science seeks concrete facts and certainty, while divinity navigates
uncertainty and abstract infinity. Bridging the gap between natural-material
experiences and the concept of God lacks a scientifically established
connection, though philosophers have made reasonable attempts within their
respective fields (Jung, 1952; Smith, 1776; Weber, 1918; Raines, 2002).
This intersection of divine belief and metaphysical philosophy delves into
consciousness beyond material explanations, often identifying coincidental
connecting parallels (Jung, as cited by White, 1956). While the predominant
epistemology of sciences can serve as a tool to explore the subject of God
(Harrison & Roberts, 2019), it's vital to acknowledge the ontological
similarities and differences between these two concepts.
One significant similarity between faith in the divine and scientific inquiry is
their shared pursuit of truth (Weber, 1918). Both endeavours seek
comprehensive answers to the world's questions. In faith, the pursuit of truth
is grounded in belief in God and ethics, prioritizing morality above all else.
This commitment to seeking truth is common among researchers in academia
and scholars of theology and religion, making them highly similar in this
regard.
However, despite this commonality, the fusion of science and faith in God is
relatively rare. Two distinct worldviews emerge: the scientific and the other
supernatural and spiritual (Collins, 2007). Nevertheless, God frequently
surfaces in existential and profound inquiries about life and meaning, and in
the post-secular shift, is slowly regaining attention in academic discourse
(Miller, 2015).

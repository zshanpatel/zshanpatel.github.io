Prosperity thinking must draw inspiration from a plethora of sources in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of human purpose (Moore et al., 2023). This section delves into the thinking for transformative change from the vantage point of a renewed Qur’anic perspective. Viewing the socio-economic-ecological tectonic change as a euphemism for eschaton. Triggered by economic overshoot and collapse (Meadows et al., 1972). It can be inferred as sequence of events that sequentially reshape structural institutions for both people and the planet. Drawing insights from eschatology offers a unique lens through which to examine current trajectory of growth and ecosystem-level crisis.

Scharmer's (2018) Theory U places emphasis on inner thinking as the source of change and recognises the importance of spirituality, morality, and ethics in addressing complex change that can transform capital-based system and institutions, educational approaches, and epistemic paradigms. The U process brings together reflections through observation for creative envisioning of ideas.

In this exploration, I specifically focus on IP as a spirito-epistemic source. Reflecting on history and the concept of "presencing" as a gateway to deeper knowledge, I relate this approach to IP's epistemic approach of seeking knowledge through introspection and transitioning from individual to collective thinking. This journey represents a spiritual and ethical awakening for collective consciousness, aligning personal and collective interests and motivations with higher moral principles. Towards an ethical and just system of a singular society or one ummah (Hosein, 1992). 

Forced change, stemming from various forms of oppression (political, economic, financial, cultural, religious), acts as a pivotal point that pressures the ecosystem into upheaval (Hosein, n.d.). Applying a Qur’anic perspective with systems thinking can bring out what Rahman (1958) envisioned as a prophesied reflection of intelligence. This approach sheds light on how such a perspective can inspire profound societal change. The fusion of spiritual and systemic viewpoints offers a unique method within systems-thinking frameworks for addressing pressing GCs, especially in the face of extreme adversity. The term eschaton typically associated with apocalyptic upheaval and ultimate reckoning, serves as a metaphor to emphasize the imperative need for transformative change (Shoemaker, 2014). In this context, the concept of _tawakkul_ (trusting in God’s plan) gains particular relevance, emphasizing ethical behaviour, and accountability. This dichotomy offers a unique perspective on navigating the challenges of our time.

## Seeing – Transcending the Econometric Focus

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis triggered a period of recessive ecosystem. The state of disturbance is recognizable in the current landscape characterized by disrupted consciousness and the deeply ingrained divergent beliefs, in spiritual versus individualist materialistic growth. In recent decades, there has been a rapid escalation of polarized perspectives both in thought and within society. The increasing socio-economic-ecologic turbulence evident within neoliberal structures is converging communities and setting a precedent for profound tectonic shifts.

On one side of the spectrum, the neoliberal machinery advocates for an ever-increasing desire for material wealth, fostering an illusion of unlimited abundance. It's a space where the elite and pseudo-elites revel in aristocratic capabilities, perceiving these facades as attainable realities. On the other side, the shrinking middle class and the destitute working-class cling to secular humanism, desperately grasping the remaining crumbs of material wealth, all while being inundated by a barrage of advertising and insatiable consumerism.

These growing polarities have opened up academic avenues for radical rethinking and have prompted the recognition that we face systemic-level challenges. Those in positions of power, albeit deliberatively and reluctantly, are beginning to relinquish their adherence to capital-centric metrics of prosperity. Instead, they are starting to grasp the necessity of adopting a more holistic approach. The consensus that emerges is one of collective prosperity achieved through an epistemic transformation. The sense of seeking spiritual and higher purpose hints towards culminating faith in God (_tawhid_) (Zepp, 2000, p. 31–70). One that purifies individuals from worldly desires, ultimately steering humanity towards a more equitable and spiritually enriched future.

## Sensing – Perceiving Theistic Naturalism

Perception, pooled by a profound shift in self-awareness, observation, and alignment of spiritual or divine senses with the natural world, engenders a deeper sense of empathy in relation to the collective. This corresponds to the recognition of the signs of the impending eschaton, underscoring the paramount earnestness of seeking divine knowledge, awareness, and moral reflection (Winter, 2008).

The Qur'an provides a robust framework for introspective thinking and reflection, drawing from intrinsic knowledge and divine sources. Exploring detachment from physical-materialist theories emerges as a fundamental doctrine, liberating individuals from the constraints of individualist thought patterns. The overwhelming burden of consumption is revealed as a pathological deviation that brings to the forefront the stark structural polarities within social systems, however without the highest level of faith (_iman_), the human tendency is to shift to the emanate natural world system.

This newfound sense of perception allows for the realization of the inherent problems stemming from human dependence on materialism and opens the door to embracing concepts that dwell on the periphery of the divine, such as naturalism and spiritualism (Oppy, 2020).

## Presencing - Divine Rejuvenation

In Qur’anic connotation, “presencing” as termed by Scharmer's (2018), signifies parallels in Islamic psychology of that of active intelligence (Rahman, 1958), which through inner contemplation is able to achieve divine inspiration from God. Prompting an inward re-examination of all actions for landscape-level changes. These changes involve aligning actions with higher moral and ethical values.

From the perspective of Islamic psychology, the divine connection with God is reflected in the social relations. Specifically, through connecting with humans, exhibits tolerance and inclusivity as deemed essential for fostering shared collective action and unity (ibid.). The concept of a higher moral system, in this context, does not intend to claim exclusivity for any particular belief system. Instead, it emphasizes the understanding that blurred lines exist among various belief systems, and these can converge on a common standing in pursuit of the collective interest. This process gradually clarifies priorities, shifting from individual needs to collective needs, transcending the hierarchy of needs (Koltko-Rivera, 2006), all in the service of unity.

## Creating - Restructuring for Higher Purpose

The concept of "_tawbah_" (repentance) emerges as a profound motivator for creating change through divine reflection. Individuals and societies alike are driven to rectify their paths within a divine framework. The idea of submission to God remains fundamental, and individuals and communities actively engage in continuous self-reflection on their actions, striving for alignment with higher pursuits through practices of "_dhikr_" (remembrance of God).

Collectively towards a superior divine psionic alignment actively seeks to restore with higher transcendental systems (Murad, 2001).

This process involves the reintroduction of higher levels of divinity and mystic harmony into society, prompting a revaluation of hierarchical structures. The outlook towards reconstruction of economic systems is instilled with a focus on collective interests, utilizing optimal state intervention and adopting radical bottom-up approaches, such as a collective servant leadership (Greenleaf, 1991). These changes aim to foster a more harmonious and just society that reflects a higher purpose.

## Evolving – Toward Utopia

The notion of "evolving" signifies the emergence of a transformed self and society, reflecting the collective aspirations for righteousness and justice, epitomized in the pursuit of collective "_tazkiyah_" (purification). Through repentance, remembrance, and purification, the collective human intellect is elevated, resulting in a continuous process of revision and collective growth in cognitive capabilities and awareness.

By embodying the principles of Qur'an, this new ecosystem paves the way for a just and sustainable system as the ultimate realization of humanity. Embracing the moral, ethical, and spiritual dimensions of transformation, it seeks to establish a socio-political-economic-ecological system that aligns with the principles of justice and inspires in divine reflection, the creation of a more equitable, and sustainable future (Murad, 2001).

The examination of Islam, both empirically and theoretically, reveals significant disparities within the contemporary secularist system, affecting both society and individuals. Despite these discrepancies, there has been a notable lack of conceptual exploration concerning monotheistic sources in the context of prosperity theory. In this study, I have endeavoured to bridge this gap by presenting a model for <span title="Universal Prosperity">UP</span>. To support this model, I conducted a comparative study that examined various empirical and conceptual pathways to prosperity. This effort has culminated in the development of a process model, elucidating how each pathway evolves, operates, and ultimately impacts the outcome. Consequently, my delineation of the <span title="Universal Prosperity">UP</span> model and construct sheds light on a Qur'anic perspective of transcendental prosperity.

In conclusion, I return to the central question: How does a Qur'anic epistemology contribute to the development of a comprehensive model for universal prosperity? The answer lies in the profound embrace of Qur'anic thinking. The pursuit of Qur'anic knowledge not only enlightens the seeker but also reveals the transformative nature of the divine connection it fosters. Through continuous contemplation and spiritual revival, a path is paved towards a form of transcendental prosperity that warrants further profound philosophical contemplation. <span title="Universal Prosperity">UP</span> integrates ethical values, spiritual contentment, mechanisms for wealth redistribution, and an unwavering commitment to social justice. This holistic approach transcends materialism, encompassing the essence of humanity.

After a thorough exploration of the research question, it becomes apparent that the Qur'an's predictive nature addresses the 'how' in relation to its contribution to <span title="Universal Prosperity">UP</span>. Furthermore, it leaves the researcher pondering the 'when' - a thought provoking question that remains open for future inquiry.

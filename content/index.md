#### Unlearn Lies: Build Legacy
_"I've won the game, but it's rigged. Who sold me this script?"_

Look, I got banned from the big platforms for calling out the elites for their fake propoganda games, the Islamophobia dressed as "patriotism." Elon? Yeah, I said it. Account gone.
But hell with that noise. It lit a fire. I built this vault for guys like you: 30s-50s, killing it in Dubai deals or London funds, but stuck code-switching between boardrooms and your roots. That ache for real legacy? The one where money stacks but soul starves? I feel it. Lived it.

I'm Zeeshan ðŸ‘‹ [UCL](https://x.com/UCL) grad who ditched the safe path to crack open Qur'anic smarts for today's chaos. Ancient rules + tech hacks = businesses you actually own. No more half-assed compromises.

What's eating you? Plateaued success? Family wealth that fades? Let's fix that shit.

> "Prosperity ain't just money, it's divine flow, fair swaps that last forever." _Me, straight from the thesis_

Grab a free taste. No strings.

#### My Scars: From the Trenches
Grew up split between worlds. Hustled ads at [BBDO](https://www.bbdo.com/), [TBWA](https://www.tbwa.com/), [DDB](https://www.ddb.com/), [MullenLowe](https://www.mullenlowe.com/); saw the machine eat souls. Then flipped to [Hackney Council](https://hackney.gov.uk/), fixing real breaks. 
[UCL](https://x.com/UCL) MSc sealed it: [Bartlett](https://x.com/TheBartlettUCL) + [Global Prosperity](https://x.com/Glo_Pro) crew taught me to question everything.

Your grind? That isolation in fancy rooms, the endless adapt? I mapped it. Broke through it. Now handing you the map.
